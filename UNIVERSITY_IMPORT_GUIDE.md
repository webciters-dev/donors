# University Data Import Guide

##  Overview

This guide explains how to import your 3000+ Pakistani university records into the AWAKE Connect database. The system supports Excel (`.xlsx`, `.xls`) and CSV (`.csv`) files.

##  File Format Requirements

Your Excel/CSV file should have these columns (case-insensitive):

| Column Name | Variations Supported | Required | Example |
|------------|---------------------|----------|---------|
| **University** | University, Uni, Institution, College |  Yes | University of the Punjab |
| **Programme** | Programme, Program, Course |  Yes | Computer Science |
| **Field** | Field, Department, Field/Department, Dept |  Yes | Computer Science |
| **Degree Level** | Degree Level, DegreeLevel, Level, Degree |  Yes | Bachelor's |

### Sample Data Structure:
```
University                              | Programme                    | Field             | Degree Level
University of the Punjab                | Computer Science             | Computer Science  | Bachelor
Lahore University of Management Sciences | Software Engineering        | Engineering       | Bachelor
National University of Sciences & Tech  | Mechanical Engineering       | Engineering       | Master
University of Karachi                   | Business Administration      | Business          | Bachelor
```

##  Import Process

### Step 1: Prepare Your Environment
```bash
cd C:\projects\donors\server
npm install
```

### Step 2: Validate Your File (Recommended)
```bash
# Check file format and preview data
npm run import:validate path/to/your/universities.xlsx

# Check current database status
npm run import:status
```

### Step 3: Create Backup (Safety First!)
```bash
# Create database backup before import
npm run import:backup
```

### Step 4: Test Import (Recommended)
```bash
# Test with sample data to ensure everything works
npm run import:test
```

### Step 5: Run Full Import
```bash
# Import your actual file
npm run import:universities path/to/your/universities.xlsx
```
