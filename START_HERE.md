# Quick Start for Developers

**Clone the repo and you're ready to go.** The `main` branch has all the production code running on aircrew.nl right now - just run `npm install && npm run dev` to start. If you want to see what issues were found during code analysis (18 issues documented: 6 critical, 6 high priority, 3 medium, 3 low), check the `analysis/codebase-issues` branch which has a detailed report showing exactly where each issue is and how to fix it. If anything ever breaks badly and you need to revert to the exact code deployed on the VPS, use the tag `v1.0.0-production` with `git checkout v1.0.0-production`. For a full explanation of the git structure and workflows, read `DEVELOPER_GUIDE_GIT_STRUCTURE.md` on the main branch. **TL;DR**: `git clone` → `npm install` → `npm run dev` → working. See `analysis/codebase-issues` branch for improvement opportunities.
