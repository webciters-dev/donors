## 4. Final Notes

Many features are still missing or need modifications which will be communicated over time.

We need to deploy an MVP once the features are updated as per this document.

Please add hysterics sign (*) to fields that are mandatory.

The pop-up for any issue/missing item like ‘Tips’ etc. currently comes on top right corner and easy to miss. We suggest to add these pop-ups in the center and with large text size.
