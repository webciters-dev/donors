🎯 ANALYSIS & RECOMMENDATION:

✅ CORRECT DATABASE: donors_db (currently connected)

REASONING:
• Most recent database creation (Nov 6, 2025)
• Latest schema migrations (Nov 9, 2025) 
• Most up-to-date Prisma schema
• Clean database ready for fresh data

⚠️  ISSUE IDENTIFIED: 
The database appears "empty" because it's the PRODUCTION-READY database
that was recently reset/cleaned for deployment, while the older databases
contain development/test data.

🔧 NEXT STEPS:
1. Keep donors_db as primary (it has the latest schema)
2. Optionally migrate important data from awake_local_db if needed
3. Clean up old databases (awake_db, awake_local_db) to avoid confusion
